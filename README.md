## About
This app is built using react.  It displays all users in a given directory and then offers methods of sorting and filtering users.  The react components are built to create a table based on any amount of information and sorts and filters can be created by feeding arrays into the Dropdown component.

Alternatively, you can fork this repo to your local device, navigate to the root, install your npm dependencies, and enter 'npm start' into your terminal. You can refill the employees.json with whatever you want, and with some minor adjustments, the app can be run with your custom dataset.
